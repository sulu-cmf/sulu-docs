If you are planning to create a pull request to this documentation repository
you may want to check if your changes are valid. You can achieve that by using
the `make` tool.

Before you can build the docs locally, make sure that you have [installed sphinx][1].

Start the building process by executing

After that you can check the result in the `_build/html` folder.
