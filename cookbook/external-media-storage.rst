Store Media in an external Storage
==================================

Sulu is able to upload newly created media files directly to an external storage provider (such as AWS S3 or
Google Cloud Storage).

.. warning::

    Please check the note about image formats / thumbnails at the end of this document.

AWS-S3
------

First install dependencies.

.. code-block:: bash

    composer require "league/flysystem:^1.0" "league/flysystem-aws-s3-v3:^1.0.1"

Configure the storage with following yaml-snippet:

.. code-block:: yaml

    sulu_media:
        storage: s3
        storages:
            s3:
                key: 'your aws s3 key'
                secret: 'your aws s3 secret'
                bucket_name: 'your aws s3 bucket name'
                path_prefix: 'optional path prefix'
                region: 'eu-west-1'

If you use s3 compatible services (e.g. minio) you can pass additional ``arguments`` and ``endpoint`` to the
configuration.

Google Cloud-Storage
--------------------

First follow this the `Google Cloud Documentation`_ to setup a System-Account and download the json-key.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "type": "service_account",
        "project_id": "project-id",
        "private_key_id": "some_number",
        "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n....
        =\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
        "client_email": "<api-name>api@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
        "client_id": "...",
        "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
        "token_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token",
        "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
        "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/...<api-name>api%40project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
    }

Install the dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

    composer require "league/flysystem:^1.0" "superbalist/flysystem-google-storage:^7.1"

Dump this file to a readable folder on your machine and configure the storage with following yaml-snippet:

.. code-block:: yaml

    sulu_media:
        storage: google_cloud
        storages:
            google_cloud:
                key_file_path: '/path/to/key.json'
                bucket_name: 'sulu-bucket'
                path_prefix: 'optional path prefix'

.. _Google Cloud Documentation: https://cloud.google.com/video-intelligence/docs/common/auth#set_up_a_service_account


Azure Blob Storage
------------------

First install dependencies.

.. code-block:: bash

    composer require "league/flysystem:^1.0" "league/flysystem-azure-blob-storage:^0.1"

Configure the storage with following yaml-snippet:

.. code-block:: yaml

    sulu_media:
        storage: azure_blob
        storages:
            azure_blob:
                connection_string: 'DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName={YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME};AccountKey={YOUR_ACCOUNT_KEY};'
                container_name: 'container-name'
                path_prefix: 'optional path prefix'

.. note::

    **What about image formats?**

    Only the original files will be uploaded to the external storage. Image Formats / Thumbnails will still be generated
    in the local directory. This is because image formats are generated in Sulu on demand, to explain in detail: when
    when an image format is requested for the first time, Sulu generates the image from the original file and stores it in the public
    directory. The web server then acts as a kind of proxy. If the image is requested again, it checks the public
    directory and directly returns the previously generated image instead of regenerating it. External storages like S3,
    Google Cloud Storage or Azure Blob Storage do not support some kind of proxy or CDN functionality.

    If you want to store the image formats in an external service you have to use a CDN like Fastly, Cloudflare or others
    that support caching generated image formats for a long time. Some hosters allow to configure CDN directly on specific URLs
    in Sulu all URLs under ``/uploads/media/*`` need to be routed through a proxy or CDN. If your chosen CDN
    requires a custom Domain, you can use Symfony's CDN feature via:

    ``{{ asset(media.thumbnail['40x40']) }}``

    and `configure a CDN Domain`_ in the Symfony configuration ``framework.assets`` configuration. If you have tested your proxy or CDN and it correctly
    caches the generated images for a long time, you can disable saving the thumbnails to the local filesystem by setting
    ``sulu_media.format_cache.save_image`` to ``false`` in ``config/packages/sulu_media.yaml``, it is recommend to use an ENV variable
    to locally still use it.

    Important: Never disable the format cache unless you have set up a CDN or proxy. Otherwise, your server will
    regenerate the image format on every request, which can overwhelm your server, as image generation is resource-intensive.
