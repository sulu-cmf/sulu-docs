Using Elasticsearch
===================

By default Sulu uses Zend Lucene for its search in the administration and on
the website. But since Sulu uses the `MassiveSearchBundle`_ it supports the
same range of different search implementations, including `Elasticsearch`_.

The `MassiveSearchBundle Documentation`_ describes how to setup Elasticsearch,
the steps explained there also work in combination with Sulu.
