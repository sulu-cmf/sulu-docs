Cleanup PHPCR database
======================

If you have an older installation of Sulu, you may be dealing with a database cluttered with outdated PHPCR properties.
This is particularly common if youâ€™ve made significant changes to your templates or content types over time.
To tidy up your database, try running the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    php bin/console sulu:document:phpcr-cleanup

The command is quite powerful, but exercise caution when deploying it in a production environment. 
It will remove all properties not currently utilized in your templates. To avoid potential pitfalls, ensure you have a 
backup of your database in place before executing this command.
