How to manage custom-urls?
==========================

Sulu gives the content-manger an easy way to manage custom-urls or landing
pages. These urls can be defined in the webspace-settings. A custom-url is
basically an additional url for a specific page. This url can have a completely
different schema as the other urls which will be generated by the system. For
example the localization is not present in this urls.

A custom-url consists of following properties:


.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Parameter
      - Description
    * - Title
      - This title will be displayed in the list and should identify the use case
        of this url.
    * - Activated
      - This flag indicates if the custom-url is shown on the website.
    * - Base Domain
      - The content-manager can choose one of the configured base-domains.
    * - Custom-Url
      - After choosing the base-domain the ``*`` can be replaced with any value.
    * - Target page and localization
      - The selected page will be displayed in the selected localization on this
        custom-url.
    * - Redirect
      - The custom URL will be redirected to URL of the the linked page.
    * - Canonical URL
      - When the Canonical URL has been activated only the linked page will be
        indexed by search engines.
    * - No Index
      - The page will not be indexed by search engines.
    * - No Follow
      - The links on the page will not be followed by search engines.

.. note::

    If the target page gets deleted the custom-url will stay in the list, will
    be marked that the target is missing and returns a 404 on the website.

Configuration
-------------

The base-domains (which can be selected) will be configured in the
``webspace.xml`` of the environment.

.. code-block:: xml

    <webspace>
        ...

        <portals>
            <portal>
                ...

                <environments>
                    ...

                    <environment type="dev">
                        <urls>
                            <url>sulu.lo/{localization}</url>
                        </urls>
                        <custom-urls>
                            <custom-url>sulu.lo/*</custom-url>
                            <custom-url>*.sulu.lo</custom-url>
                            <custom-url>*.sulu.lo/*</custom-url>
                        </custom-urls>
                    </environment>
                </environments>
            </portal>
        </portals>
    </webspace>

It is possible to set a wildcard (*) for subdomains and folders, which can be
replaced by arbitrary values when creating a custom-url.

.. note::

    Be aware of that different sub-domains or different domains has to be
    configured on the webserver. Very important is that you configure a wildcard
    for the subdomain if you will use it for custom-urls.
