Improve Sitemap Speed
=====================

The sitemap of sulu is based on small pices which are generated by
so-called `SitemapProvider` (see :doc:`sitemap-provider`). Each
provider returns mostly 50000 links which can take a bigger amount
of time. The Google bot is quite busy and dont want to wait long
for the sitemap to load - therefor Sulu is able to pre-generate the
whole sitemap and cache it on the filesystem. This can be triggered
by calling the following command by a cron-job each night.

.. code-block:: bash

    app/websiteconsole sulu:website:dump-sitemap
