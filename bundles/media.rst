MediaBundle
===========

The MediaBundle is responsible for the handling of all media assets in Sulu.
It also offers functionality for resizing and scaling images automatically.
Assets can be grouped in nestable collections for better organization.

Security
--------

Separate permissions can be applied to every collection. These permissions also
apply to the assets contained in the collection.

So the `view` permission is required to see the collection itself in the
navigation and its assets in any available view in the system.

The `add` permission is needed to upload new assets and add new subcollections
to a collection. With the `edit` permission the user is allowed to edit the
title and other attributes of the collections and its containing assets, and
finally the `delete` permission is required to delete assets and entire
collections.
