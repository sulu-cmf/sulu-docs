Header
======

The header-hook renders a header (the blue bar with the toolbar in it) into your component.
Moreover it takes care of the tab-handling.

Most often you'll find yourself defining a component which contains the header-hook and
methods for manipulating the toolbar or other methods which implement behaviour which is
the same over all tabs.

The header-hook in such a component could look something like:

.. code-block:: javascript

    header: function() {
        return {
            tabs: {
                url: 'url/to/tabsData',
                componentOptions: {
                    values: this.data
                }
            },
            toolbar: {
                languageChanger: true,
                    buttons: {
                    save: {},
                    settings: {
                       options: {
                           dropdownItems: {
                               delete: {}
                           }
                       }
                    }
                }
            },
            title: 'My title'
        };
    }

What this hook does is essentially the following:

* It initializes the tabs with the data returned from the defined url. From then on
  you'll never have to worry about tabs again. The whole routing to and starting your
  tabs component is handled automatically if the data returned by ``tabs.url`` has
  the right format.
* It initializes the toolbar with the defined buttons. For information on how to configure buttons
  and even how to create your own buttons have look :doc:`/bundles/admin/sulu-buttons`.
* It injects the title into every tab (or into your current component if no tabs specified)

.. note::
    The header-hook can also be a function which returns the object seen in the
    example. Within this function you have access to things like
    ``this.options``.

Tab Conditions
--------------

To enable tab-conditions in the header you have to do following steps:

1. Set the option `tabs.componentOptions.values`. This object will be
   used to evaluate the conditions.
2. Emit the event `this.sandbox.emit('sulu.header.saved', savedData)` with the
   newly saved data. This will update the tabs and reevaluate the conditions
   with given data.
