Reference
=========

In our reference we'll describe how to configure stuff and how to use existing things. You can find list of functionality we put in Sulu and how you could use it. At the moment there are components like e.g. `Document Manager <components/document-manager/index.html>`_, `Content Types <content-types/index.html>`_ and `Twig Extensions <twig-extensions/index.html>`_.
The Reference aims to developers who already worked through the introduction and know how Sulu works.
