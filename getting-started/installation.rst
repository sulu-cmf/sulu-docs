Installation
============

Get the code
------------

First of all you have to clone the `sulu-standard repository on GitHub
<https://github.com/sulu-cmf/sulu-standard>`_ and change into the cloned
directory :behat:`Given I execute the following`:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone git@github.com:sulu-cmf/sulu-standard.git

:behat:`Then the command should not fail`

After the clone has finished, you can change to the cloned directory, and
checkout the desired version of Sulu :behat:`And I execute the following`:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd sulu-standard
    git checkout 0.6.0

:behat:`Then the command should not fail`

Configure PHPCR
---------------

Before executing any other commands, you need to configure the PHPCR
implementation. 

You have to decide how you store the content - you have the choice
between:

- `Jackalope Jackrabbit`_: Uses `Apache Jackrabbit`_ as a storage backend.
- `Jackalope Doctrine-Dbal`_: Uses the a relational database as a storage backend.

To use Jackrabbit:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cp app/config/phpcr_jackrabbit.yml.dist app/config/phpcr.yml

To use a relational database :behat:`Given I execute the following`:

.. code-block:: bash

    cp app/config/phpcr_doctrine_dbal.yml.dist app/config/phpcr.yml

:behat:`Then the command should not fail`

The copied file contains some defaults, which will run out of the box. However,
on a production system you should adjust the values ``phpcr_workspace``, 
``phpcr_user`` and ``phpcr_pass`` to some meaningful values.

.. note::

    Jackrabbit is the reference implementation of PHPCR and supports the whole
    specification, whereas the doctrine-dbal implementation does not - it is
    however more lightweight and does not have external dependencies.

Install dependencies
--------------------

We use `composer`_ to install the correct versions of
Sulu's dependencies:

You can install composer as follows :behat:`Given I execute the following`:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

:behat:`Then the command should not fail`
:behat:`And the file "composer.phar" should exist`

Then install the dependencies :behat:`Given I execute the following`:

.. code-block:: bash

    php composer.phar install

:behat:`Then the command should not fail`

Now check that everything is working :behat:`Given I execute the following`:

.. code-block:: bash

    php app/console

:behat:`Then the command should not fail`

At the end of the installation you will be asked for some parameters. The
following table describes these parameters, whereby most of the default values
should be fine for simple installations.
