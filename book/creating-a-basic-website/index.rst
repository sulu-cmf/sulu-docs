Creating a basic website
========================

In :doc:`../getting-started/index` we got Sulu running. Now it is time to create
a website. We'll have another look at the Sulu content architecture and 
afterwards work through the process of building a website. We'll define 
webspaces and templates, add a theme, write twig templates and get a little bit 
into smart content and localization.

At first we'll have another look at the content architecture on a technical level
and afterwards we will create stuff.
