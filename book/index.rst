The Book
========

When you work through the book you'll build a website based on Sulu from scratch. At first we explain some of our very basic design decisions. Based on that we'll get your project started.

Be sure to know a thing or two about `Symfony`_. Sulu is based on Symfony and structured according to the Symfony standards. If you don't know how to work within the Symfony framework you might encounter some problems when using Sulu.
