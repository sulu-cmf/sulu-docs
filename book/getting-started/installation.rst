Installation
============

After working through this page you'll have a running Sulu instance. At first we'll
load Sulu and afterwards dependent packages.

Get the code
------------

First of all you have to clone the `sulu-standard repository on GitHub
<https://github.com/sulu-io/sulu-standard>`_ and change into the cloned
directory.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/sulu-io/sulu-standard.git

After the clone has finished, you can change to the cloned directory, and
checkout the latest version of Sulu:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd sulu-standard
    $ git checkout master

Install dependencies
--------------------

We use `composer`_ to install the correct versions of
Sulu's dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

    composer install

At the end of the installation you will be asked for some parameters. The
following table describes these parameters, whereby most of the default values
should be fine for simple installations.
