Introduction
===============

We created Sulu because we believe some things could work different - in
terms of content management - than they do at the moment.
In Sulu there's a lot of discussion, reflection, experience and passion. We
made a lot of decisions and want to give you a short overview on why we chose
to do things the way we do them.

It is important to understand the underlying concepts of Sulu,
but if you want to skip this part and start coding, head over
