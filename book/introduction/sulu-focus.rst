On what does Sulu focus?
========================

While developing Sulu we had a special vision in mind. Besides "Content 
management made awesome" we wanted to create a technology that

* supports what a business needs.
* looks good and is easy to use.
* helps developers excel.


Business
--------

Our world is going global. Businesses target several markets where several 
languages are spoken. Companies are splited into brands with dozens of products.
Complex structures arise. With Sulu we build up a data pool which feeds a set of
portals in a couple of languages.


Design
------

We put a lot of love and manpower into the design and  user interface of our
administration area. Editors are guided intuitive through a clean set of 
organized screens. The live preview provides immediate and robust visual 
feedback. You can't create ugly content, it will directly get back on you.


Technology
----------

Developers should focus on building awesome applications. They should not think
about where they put things and how to structure them. They also shouldn't think
about on how to hack stuff. That's why we chose Symfony as a base. A clean, 
modern framework that allows developers to adapt, extend and modify 
functionality where ever they want.

We learned what Sulu focus on. Next we'll show what comes with Sulu in a basic 
installation.
