About the Sulu Content Architecture
===================================

We already heard something about :doc:`introduction/content-architecture`
in the introduction.
Now we are starting to code will dig a little bit deeper.


Sulu uses `PHPCR`_ as a persistence layer, and therefore follows its structure.
Additionally Sulu adds another layer called webspaces, which have already been
explained in the section about the :doc:`introduction/components`. These
webspaces contain an arbitrary number of pages, which are ordered in a tree in
a hierarchical way. Each of these pages can contain content in many different
localizations.

This tree also represents the actual structure of the website, so that no
additional navigation tree is required. Pages can be enabled in the navigation,
and will then appear in the right spot on the navigation of the website.

The pages in Sulu have a specific template applied. The template defines which
properties the page will have, whereby each of these properties are further
specified by a content type. The content type will have a direct impact on the
possible values and configuration possibilities of the property it is applied
to. There is also a further reference of all the available
:doc:`../reference/content-types/index`.

There are also some advanced features regarding the pages in Sulu. Besides the
content management using the properties and content types already described
there is also the possibility to define internal and external links. Internal
links redirect to other pages managed by the content management section of
Sulu, and external link to an arbitrary URL.

Another useful feature is the shadow page functionality. It allows to use the
content of another localization. So if a webspace defines localizations for
American and British English, it is possible to use the content of the American
English for the British English, without managing the exactly same content
again. This is especially useful if there are e.g. different contact addresses
for each country, but the rest of the page should be exactly the same.

With the content architecture on our mind we'll create a webspace.
