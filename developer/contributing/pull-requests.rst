Creating a Pull Request
=======================

When creating a pull request:

* Clone the Sulu repository from git.
* Add a branch and name it after the following format: ``<type>/<description>``, where
  type is one of ``feature``, ``bugfix``, ``hotfix`` or ``enhancement``. For
  example: ``feature/what-my-pr-does``. Note that dashes should be used
  instead of spaces (not underscores).
* Add your feature/bugfix/enhancement.
* Write tests.
* :doc:`test-your-code`.
* Add a line in the format of "<type> <pr-number>
  [<affected bundle or component>] <description>" to the ``CHANGELOG.md`` file
  in the root directory.
* In case you have some changes breaking backwards compability you also have to
  add a description to the ``UPGRADE.md`` file in the root directory.
* Use a meaningful name for the pull request.
* Create the pull request as soon as possible.

If you are a member of the `Sulu organization`_ you should also:

* Add a label for the type of the PR:

 * **feature**: provides a new feature
 * **enhancement**: the PR improves existing features
 * **bugfix**: provides a bug fix
 * **hotfix**: the PR is a bugfix that should be made against a stable branch
   (e.g. ``master``)

Template
--------

Template is divided in two parts: *tasks* (for developer) and *information*
(for reviewer).

The information should include the following fields:

* **Fixed tickets**: **list of tickets**; Tickets to close after merge. These
  should be of the form ``fixes #123, fixes #321``.
* **Related PRs**: **link to PRs`**, PRs that are required for the current one
* **BC breaks**: **none or description**; any compatibility breaking changes
* **Documentation PR**: **link to PR**; Link to the documentation PR
  (if applicable)

.. note::

  When an issue number is prefixed with ``fixes`` it tells GitHub to
  automatically close the referenced ticket when the PR is merged

You can copy and paste the following template:

.. code-block:: none
